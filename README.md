# Decentralized Energy Marketplace (DEM) via NFTs and AI-based Agents

## Overview
This project introduces an advanced Decentralized Energy Marketplace (DEM) integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to manage energy exchanges among smart homes with energy storage systems. Using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent unique energy profiles, the system fosters a transparent and secure trading environment. The core innovation lies in leveraging Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) for collaborative and adaptive energy management strategies while maintaining user privacy.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration:** NFTs for individual energy profiles on a smart contract-based marketplace.
- **AI in Energy Systems:** Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) for collaborative energy management.
- **Virtual Power Plants (VPP):** Combining AI agents with household batteries.
- **Oracle Integration:** Utilizing Chainlink for real-time data integration with smart contracts.

## System Model
- **Smart Homes with Energy Storage:** Equipped with AI for energy use monitoring and management.
- **DEM Platform:** A decentralized application (DApp) for secure and transparent energy exchange.
- **FDRL Framework:** Enables smart buildings to refine energy strategies collaboratively.
- **VPP and Grid Operators:** Integration of DEM, smart homes, and FDRL agents to create a VPP.

## Blockchain-enabled Smart Contracts
- **EnergyProfile Contract:** Manages participants' energy profiles.
- **EnergyPool Contract:** Handles energy commitments and aggregates supply-demand.
- **EnergyMarket Contract:** Core operational link among contracts, managing transactions and settlements.
